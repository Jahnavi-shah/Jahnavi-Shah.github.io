  <h1>Addressing Physician Burnout and Turnover at RWJBarnabas Health</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">
    Scientific and Technical Writing · Project Proposal
  </div>

  <p>
    This project was developed as part of a Scientific and Technical Writing course
    and focused on proposing a system-level intervention to address physician burnout
    and turnover at RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH). Rather than framing burnout as an
    individual failure, the proposal approached it as a structural and organizational
    challenge requiring coordinated policy, leadership, and workforce interventions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The report synthesized peer-reviewed literature to evaluate evidence-based
    strategies including mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), peer support
    programs, leadership training, and workload optimization through flexible
    scheduling. Economic considerations were central to the proposal, with detailed
    analysis of physician replacement costs, productivity loss, and long-term
    retention benefits.
  </p>

  <p>
    A comprehensive implementation plan was developed, outlining funding pathways,
    projected costs, and anticipated outcomes related to workforce stability,
    physician well-being, and patient care quality. This project demonstrates the
    ability to translate research findings into actionable, budget-conscious policy
    recommendations within complex healthcare systems.
