  </div>

  <p>
    During my internship at Ethicon (Johnson & Johnson), I developed a custom
    Schlenk line setup to support the synthesis of Karstedt catalyst, a platinum-
    based organometallic compound that is extremely sensitive to oxygen and
    moisture. The system was designed to provide continuous access to an inert
    nitrogen atmosphere while enabling precise vacuum control for solvent
    removal.
  </p>

  <p>
    A critical requirement of the process was achieving a reduced pressure of
    approximately 15 mmHg to fully remove residual solvent from the catalyst
    solution. Even trace solvent contamination was found to introduce impurities
    that adversely affected catalyst performance. The setup therefore integrated
    both inert gas handling and controlled vacuum application.
  </p>

  <p>
    To prevent environmental exposure during transfers and reagent addition,
    cannulation techniques were employed throughout the synthesis. This allowed
    solutions to be transferred and new reagents introduced without breaking
    the inert atmosphere, ensuring catalyst purity and reproducibility.

      <strong>Custom Schlenk Line Configuration:</strong>
      Shown is the multi-port Schlenk line developed to support Karstedt catalyst
      synthesis under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The setup integrates parallel
      reaction flasks, vacuum control capable of reaching approximately 15 mmHg
      for solvent removal, and septum-sealed access points for cannulation-based
      reagent transfer. This configuration enabled oxygen-free handling of highly
      reactive organometallic species and minimized contamination during synthesis.
