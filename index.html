  <h1>Jahnavi Shah</h1>
  <p>
    Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I recently graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering from Rutgers University. My experiences span academic research, industry R&D in medical adhesives, and clinical work in emergency department, which has shaped my perspective about engineering in healthcare. Much of my work has been focused on biomaterials, wound healing, and drug delievery. You can find a collection of my research, projects, and technical experiences under the Engineering tab.

    Feel free to reach out to me to learn more about my work.

        We developed a 3D-printed stamp–based in vitro assay to model epithelial wounds by creating uniform, reproducible abrasions in keratinocyte monolayers under low-nutrient conditions. The stamp generates four consistent scratches per well in a 96-well plate, achieving less than 10% variation and enabling high-throughput, resource-efficient testing. Compared to traditional pipette-tip methods, this system significantly improves reproducibility and quantitative analysis of wound closure.

       Introduction to Biomechanics (14:125:308): For the final project, our team analyzed the effects of different stages of gestation on lower back pain. While lower back pain is often reported early in pregnancy, its biomechanical causes evolve as gestation progresses. Using free-body diagrams and static equilibrium modeling, we examined how changes in spinal curvature, body weight, and center of mass across trimesters influence spinal forces. Our analysis showed that changes in lumbar spinal curvature, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy, are the dominant contributor to increased back pain. These findings highlight the importance of biomechanical modeling in understanding pregnancy-related discomfort and informing potential mitigation strategies.

       BME Measurement and Analysis Laboratory (14:125:315) – Fluorescence Microscopy: For this laboratory project, we explored fluorescence microscopy as a quantitative tool for biomedical image capture and analysis. We applied fluorescence imaging to evaluate signal-to-noise ratio under varying exposure times, perform live/dead cell viability analysis, and quantify cell populations using ImageJ and MATLAB. Additionally, we used Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) to analyze molecular diffusion and estimate the viscosity of protein-dense droplets.

        Fundamentals of Tissue Engineering 1 (14:125:433):For this final project, our team designed a degradable biocomposite scaffold for articular cartilage regeneration using a PEGDA–collagen hydrogel system. The scaffold was engineered to support mesenchymal stem cell chondrogenesis while providing patient-specific, controllable degradation profiles. By incorporating synthetic cannabinoids, the design aimed to reduce inflammation, enhance stem cell survival, and promote chondrocyte differentiation through endocannabinoid signaling pathways. We proposed a bioprinting-based fabrication workflow and evaluation strategy combining molecular, histological, and mechanical testing.
